## Project Overview

This project is a **full-stack backend** for a chat and communication platform. The system is built using **Node.js** with **Express.js** and leverages various other technologies such as **MongoDB** for database storage, **Redis** for caching, **Cloudinary** for file uploads, **JWT** (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication, and **Socket.io** for real-time communication. The application provides user authentication, chat functionalities (both group and direct messaging), course integration, role-based access control, and file uploading capabilities.

### Technology Stack

- **Node.js & Express**: Core backend framework for building REST APIs.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: NoSQL database for handling persistent data.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store, used for caching chat messages and user data to optimize read operations.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Provides secure authentication with token-based authorization.
- **Socket.io**: Enables real-time bi-directional communication between clients and the server.
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud storage for handling media uploads, such as images, videos, and documents.
- **Agora**: Real-time engagement platform to generate tokens for video and voice call features.
- **Winston**: Logging system that provides tracking for errors, request flows, and exceptions.

### Core Functionalities

1. **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup using JWT tokens. Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt**.
2. **Chat Features**: Real-time chat with direct messages, course-based group messaging, and media sharing.
3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Users are assigned roles (student, lecturer, HOD), with role-specific access to certain routes.
4. **Media Uploads**: Supports uploads for images, documents, videos, and audio files, which are stored in Cloudinary.
5. **Caching**: Optimized caching with Redis for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data (e.g., user lists, chat histories).

## Folder and File Structure Breakdown

### 1. **`src/`**

The core source directory that contains the codebase. It is organized into subfolders based on functionality such as controllers, models, routes, middleware, and utility files (helpers, logs).

---

### **1.1. Controllers Folder (`src/controllers`)**

Controllers are responsible for handling logic related to specific routes. They receive HTTP requests, process them, and return responses. Here are the controllers in detail:

#### **`authController.ts`**

Manages user authentication, including login, password reset, and session management.

- **Key imports**:
  - **`User`** from `../models/userModel`: Used to query user data from the MongoDB database.
  - **`bcrypt`**: Used to hash and verify passwords.
  - **`jwt`**: Used to generate and validate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user sessions.
  - **`nodemailer`**: Sends emails for password recovery.
  - **`logger`**: Logs errors or information.

- **Functions**:
  - **`login(req: Request, res: Response)`**: Handles user login. It:
    - Validates the user data using the `validateUser` function from the user model.
    - Finds the user in the database using their `indexNumber`.
    - Uses `bcrypt.compare` to check the password.
    - Generates a JWT token and stores it in cookies, with options like `httpOnly` for security.
    - Logs any errors encountered and returns relevant responses.

  - **`forgotPassword(req: Request, res: Response)`**: Manages forgotten password requests by:
    - Finding the user by `indexNumber`.
    - Generating a token with a short expiration (5 minutes) using a combination of the password and a JWT secret.
    - Sends an email with the password reset link.
    - Uses `nodemailer` to send the email via a Gmail service.

  - **`resetPasswordPost(req: Request, res: Response)`**: Handles the actual password reset:
    - Verifies the reset token.
    - Validates the new password using the `validatePassword` helper function.
    - Hashes the new password using `bcrypt` and updates the database.

#### **`chatController.ts`**
